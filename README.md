# Interactive Page: Mouse Tracker & Dynamic Colors

This project features an interactive web page with dynamic elements and user interactions.

## Features:

*   **Mouse Tracker:** Continuously displays the current X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer in the top-left corner of the screen.
*   **Dynamic Background Colors (Button):** A dedicated button allows users to instantly change the page's background to a randomly generated color.
*   **Dynamic Background Colors (Page Click):** Clicking anywhere on the page (outside the dedicated "Change Background Color" button) will also change the background to a new random color, providing a more immersive interactive experience.

## How to use:

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Move your mouse around the page to see the coordinates update in real-time.
3.  Click the "Change Background Color" button to cycle through random background colors.
4.  Click anywhere else on the page (e.g., on the background, text, etc.) to also change the background color.
